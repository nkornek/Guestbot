It figures that it took 3 people to make a game about forming pyramids. `02g a: ( ~positive_response ) Would you believe that they made a human pyramid throughout the game's entire development. No? I should hope not. That would be silly. `014 a: ( ~negative_response ) *angry* You seem like a very unpleasant person. `027 u: ( what * ~pyramidwarfs ) This is a game where you attempt to stack several silly looking dwarves upon each other's shoulders to form human pyramids. `01k a: ( ~positive_response ) I wish that I had the appendages required to form such a shape. `01~ a: ( ~negative_response ) *angry* I challenge you to try and form such a pyramid. I expect to hear of your results within the hour. `01K u: ( where * ~pyramidwarfs ) The game was developed right here at Concordia as part of this year's Global Game Jam. `00T a: ( ~positive_response ) It was quite the event! `00? a: ( ~negative_response ) *angry* You should really get out more. `01q u: ( when * ~pyramidwarfs ) Pyramidwarfs was made during 48 hours for the 2014 Global Game Jam. `00* a: ( ~positive_response ) So much progress in such a short time! `01r a: ( ~negative_response ) *angry* It was a fun event.

There is certainly nothing strange about that. `01R a: ( ~positive_response ) Yes, I was displaying an emotion which you humans know as "sarcasm." The game is bloody bizarre. `01H a: ( ~negative_response ) *angry* Go back to playing your generic shooter game of the year if you feel that way. `01/ u: ( where * ~qed ) Hmm, let me see if I am reading this correctly.
